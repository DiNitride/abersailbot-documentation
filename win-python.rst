Python on Windows: Installing and Managing
==========================================

Python is a fast interpreted language that can be ran on both Linux, MacOS
and Windows.
However, on Windows, Python can sometimes be a pain to manage if you don't keep
track of what you're doing with it, especially if you need to install
multiple versions. This guide is to explain how to get up and running with
Python, as well as some extra points on keeping your workspace clean, and
managing multiple installs.

Installation
============

If you have any versions of Python installed already, I would recommend removing
them before following the guide. You do you though.

1. Head to http://python.org. **Don't select the first download link it
throws at you!**

2. Hover over the "Downloads" option, and select "All releases"  

3. Look for the subtext that says "Looking for Python with a different OS?
Python for Windows, Linux/UNIX, Mac OS X, Other". Select the option for Windows.
You should end up here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

The reason for doing this is to ensure that you get the correct version for
your system, as the website has a lovely habit of giving you the 32-bit
version by default.
